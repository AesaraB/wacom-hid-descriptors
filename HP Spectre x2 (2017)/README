Manufacturer: HP
Model Name: HP Spectre x2 (2017)
Model Number: 

Notes:
Pictures of this device show a pen that looks very similar to a Wacom
AES-type pen, but the Linux kernel does not currently seem to detect
any kind of Wacom hardware. The output of journalctl and some searching
indicates that this device may have an Intel Precise Touch controller
**or** an Elan controller which is in charge of the pen and touch. Hard
to know which is doing it without additional debugging (e.g. from inside
Windows).
