Notes: 
This device's touch sensor can be configured to operate in either "Android /
Chrome" mode or "Windows" mode in its OSD. Toggling the switch does not
appear to trigger any changes in how the device appears to the system. The
same VID:PID and HID descriptor are used in both cases. See an additional pair
of sysinfo data at https://github.com/linuxwacom/xf86-input-wacom/issues/174#issuecomment-867810514

VID:PID = 0003:2D1F:524C

The hardware exposes two USB HID endpoints: one with a combination of standard
multitouch and pen descriptors, and the second with a multitouch-like descriptor
that only has room for a single contact per report. The two touch descriptors
use different physical and logical sizes: 309.3mm x 174.0mm (12372 x 6960 points)
and 309.31mm x 173.99mm (30931 x 17399 points) respectively. The pen descriptor
appears to be for a tilt-capable AES sensor.
