Manufacturer: HP
Model Name: HP ENVY x360 Convertible
Model Number: 15-cp0xxx

Notes:
This device uses an i2c ELAN sensor with ACPI ID ELAN0732:00 and HID ID 04F3:264C.
It has both pen and touchscreen, similar to Wacom's AES devices.

This convertible (originally reported with a Ryzen 2500U APU) had issues with its
ACPI tables that prevented the touchscreen/pen from coming up properly. See
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198715 for more information.
